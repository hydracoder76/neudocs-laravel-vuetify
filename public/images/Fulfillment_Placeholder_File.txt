If Neubus fulfills a request, in part or in full, without uploading via SRM 
directly into that request, then this text file 
(Fulfillment_Placeholder_File.txt) is added in lieu of an uploaded file.

Neubus may do this for a number of reasons, including but not limited to:
  - The source material for one or more parts in the request was not in 
    Neubus's custody.
  - Neubus fulfilled the request by some other means, such as uploading 
    directly into neuDocs Enterprise.
  - The request included a part that had previously been requested and 
    fulfilled.

If this text file appears by itself in the ZIP file downloaded in association 
with a request, then users can conclude every part in the request has been done 
this way.

If this file appears alongside other files in the ZIP file downloaded in 
association with a request, then users can conclude that there is at least one 
part in the request which has been fulfilled this way, while Neubus has also 
uploaded via SRM into at least one part in the request. (In the case of Neubus 
fulfilling a request that includes a part which had previously been requested 
and fulfilled before, these parts could be the same part.)
